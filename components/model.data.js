Today many businesses will offer veterans a cup of coffee or a meal, but one organization goes further. </p>\n\n<p>You might have watched ex-Army Captain David Molina speak at CodeConf LA, or GitHub Universe about <a href=\"https://operationcode.org/\">Operation Code</a>, a nonprofit he founded in 2014 after he couldn’t use the benefits of the G.I. Bill to pay for code school. Operation Code lowers the barrier of entry into software development and helps military personnel in the United States better their economic outcomes as they transition to civilian life. They leverage open source communities to provide accessible online mentorship, education, and networking opportunities. </p>\n\n<p>The organization is also deeply invested in facilitating policy changes that will allow veterans to use their <a href=\"http://benefits.va.gov/gibill/\">G.I. Bill</a> benefits at coding schools and boot camps, speeding up their re-entry to the workforce. Next week Captain Molina will testify in Congress as to the need for these updates. The video below explains more about their work. </p>\n\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/124866675\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p></p><p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/124866675\">Operation Code - On a mission to expand the GI Bill</a> </p>\n\n<p>Although Operation Code currently focuses on the United States, they hope to develop a model that can be replicated throughout the world. </p>\n\n<h3>\n<a id=\"why-operation-code-matters\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#why-operation-code-matters\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Why Operation Code matters</h3>\n\n<p>Operation Code is working to address a problem that transcends politics.

You can comment on specific lines of code, formally \"approve\" or \"request changes\" to pull requests, batch comments, and have multiple conversations per line. These initial improvements are only the first step of a much greater roadmap toward faster, friendlier code reviews.</p>\n\n<h2>\n<a id=\"organize-projects-while-staying-close-to-your-code\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#organize-projects-while-staying-close-to-your-code\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Organize projects while staying close to your code</h2>\n\n<p>With Projects, you can manage work directly from your GitHub repositories. Create task cards from pull requests, issues, or notes and drag and drop them into categorized columns. You can use categories like \"In-progress\", \"Done\", \"Never going to happen\", or any other framework your team prefers. Move the cards within a column to prioritize them or from one column to another as your work progresses.

They provide an easy way to ensure that your site's URLs will always appear correctly, regardless of where or how your site is viewed. To make it easier to use these two new filters, GitHub Pages now automatically sets the <code>site.url</code> and <code>site.baseurl</code> properties, if they're not already set.</p>\n\n<p>This means that starting today <code>{{ \"/about/\" | relative_url }}</code> will produce <code>/repository-name/about/</code> for Project Pages (and <code>/about/</code> for User Pages). Additionally, <code>{{ \"/about/\" | absolute_url }}</code> will produce <code>https://baxterthehacker.github.io/repository-name/about/</code> for Project Pages (and <code>https://baxterthehacker.github.io/about/</code> for User Pages or <code>http://example.com/about/</code> if you have a custom domain set up).</p>\n\n<p>Second, with Jekyll 3.3, when you run <code>jekyll serve</code> in development, it will override your url value with http://localhost:4000. No more confusion when your locally-modified CSS isn't loading because the URL is set to the production site. Additionally, <code>site.url</code> and <code>absolute_url</code> will now yield http://localhost:4000 when running a server locally.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, to make it easier to vendor third-party dependencies via package managers like Bundler or NPM (or Yarn), Jekyll now ignores the <code>vendor</code> and <code>node_modules</code> directories by default, speeding up build times and avoiding potential errors. If you need those directories included in your site, set <code>exclude: []</code> in your site's configuration file.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/docs/history/#v3-3-0\">the Jekyll changelog</a> and if you have any questions, please <a href=\"https://github.com/contact?form%5Bsubject%5D=Jekyll%203.3\">let us know</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Happy publishing!</p>",

It’s our responsibility not only to keep your information safe but also to protect the trust you have placed in us. GitHub would not exist without your trust, and we are deeply sorry that this incident occurred. </p>\n\n<p>Below is the technical analysis of our investigation, including a high-level overview of the incident, how we mitigated it, and the specific measures we are taking to safeguard against incidents like this from happening in the future.</p>\n\n<h2>\n<a id=\"high-level-overview\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#high-level-overview\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>High-level overview</h2>\n\n<p>In order to speed up unicorn worker boot times, and simplify the post-fork boot code, we applied the following buggy patch:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/183738/19815273/ef98d85a-9cf6-11e6-9490-63310008f556.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/183738/19815273/ef98d85a-9cf6-11e6-9490-63310008f556.png\" alt=\"diff\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The database connections in our rails application are split into three pools: a read-only group, a group used by Spokes (our distributed Git back-end), and the normal Active Record connection pool. The read-only group and the Spokes group are managed manually, by our own connection handling code. This meant the pool was shared between all child processes of the rails application when running using the change. The new line of code disconnected only <code>ConnectionPool</code> objects that are managed by Active Record, whereas the previous snippet would disconnect all <code>ConnectionPool</code> objects held in memory.</p>\n\n<p>The impact of this bug for most queries was a malformed response, which errored and caused a near immediate rollback. However, a very small percentage of the queries responses were interpreted as legitimate data in the form of the file server and disk path where repository data was stored. Some repository requests were routed to the location of another repository. The application could not differentiate these incorrect query results from legitimate ones, and as a result, users received data that they were not meant to receive. </p>\n\n<p>When properly functioning, the system works as sketched out roughly below. However, during this failure window, the MySQL response in step 4 was returning malformed data that would end up causing the git proxy to return data from the wrong file server and path.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/183738/19815048/dcc27188-9cf5-11e6-9523-3d7a5d24c960.jpeg\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/183738/19815048/dcc27188-9cf5-11e6-9523-3d7a5d24c960.jpeg\" alt=\"System Diagram\" style=\"max-width:100%;\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Our analysis of the ten-minute window in question uncovered:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>17 million requests to our git proxy tier, most of which failed with errors due to the buggy deploy</li>\n<li>2.5 million requests successfully reached git-daemon on our file server tier</li>\n<li>Of the 2.5 million requests that reached our file servers, the vast majority were \"already up to date\" no-op fetches</li>\n<li>40,000 of the 2.5 million requests were non-empty fetches</li>\n<li>230 of the 40,000 non-empty requests were susceptible to this bug and served incorrect data</li>\n<li>This represented 0.0013% of the total operations at the time</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n<a id=\"deeper-analysis-and-forensics\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#deeper-analysis-and-forensics\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Deeper analysis and forensics</h2>\n\n<p>After establishing the effects of the bug, we set out to determine which requests were affected in this way for the duration of the deploy. Normally, this would be an easy task, as we have an in-house monitor for Git that logs every repository access. However, those logs contained some of the same faulty data that led to the misrouted requests in the first place. Without accurate usernames or repository names in our primary Git logs, we had to turn to data that our git proxy and git-daemon processes sent to syslog. In short, the goal was to join records from the proxy, to git-daemon, to our primary Git logging, drawing whatever data was accurate from each source. Correlating records across servers and data sources is a challenge because the timestamps differ depending on load, latency, and clock skew. In addition, a given Git request may be rejected at the proxy or by git-daemon before it reaches Git, leaving records in the proxy logs that don’t correlate with any records in the git-daemon or Git logs.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, we joined the data from the proxy to our Git logging system using timestamps, client IPs, and the number of bytes transferred and then to git-daemon logs using only timestamps. In cases where a record in one log could join several records in another log, we considered all and took the worst-case choice. We were able to identify cases where the repository a user requested, which was recorded correctly at our git proxy, did not match the repository actually sent, which was recorded correctly by git-daemon.</p>\n\n<p>We further examined the number of bytes sent for a given request. In many cases where incorrect data was sent, the number of bytes was far larger than the on-disk size of the repository that was requested but instead closely matched the size of the repository that was sent. This gave us further confidence that indeed some repositories were disclosed in full to the wrong users.</p>\n\n<p>Although we saw over 100 misrouted fetches and clones, we saw no misrouted pushes, signaling that the integrity of the data was unaffected. This is because a Git push operation takes place in two steps: first, the user uploads a pack file containing files and commits. Then we update the repository’s refs (branch tips) to point to commits in the uploaded pack file. These steps look like a single operation from the user’s point of view, but within our infrastructure, they are distinct. To corrupt a Git push, we would have to misroute both steps to the same place. If only the pack file is misrouted, then no refs will point to it, and git fetch operations will not fetch it. If only the refs update is misrouted, it won’t have any pack file to point to and will fail. In fact, we saw two pack files misrouted during the incident. They were written to a temporary directory in the wrong repositories. However, because the refs-update step wasn’t routed to the same incorrect repository, the stray pack files were never visible to the user and were cleaned up (i.e., deleted) automatically the next time those repositories performed a “git gc” garbage-collection operation. So no permanent or user-visible effect arose from any misrouted push.</p>\n\n<p>A misrouted Git pull or clone operation consists of several steps. First, the user connects to one of our Git proxies, via either SSH or HTTPS (we also support git-protocol connections, but no private data was disclosed that way). The user’s Git client requests a specific repository and provides credentials, an SSH key or an account password, to the Git proxy. The Git proxy checks the user’s credentials and confirms that the user has the ability to read the repository he or she has requested. At this point, if the Git proxy gets an unexpected response from its MySQL connection, the authentication (which user is it?) or authorization (what can they access?) check will simply fail and return an error. Many users were told during the incident that their repository access “was disabled due to excessive resource use.”</p>\n\n<p>In the operations that disclosed repository data, the authentication and authorization step succeeded. Next, the Git proxy performs a routing query to see which file server the requested repository is on, and what its file system path on that server will be. This is the step where incorrect results from MySQL led to repository disclosures. In a small fraction of cases, two or more routing queries ran on the same Git proxy at the same time and received incorrect results. When that happened, the Git proxy got a file server and path intended for another request coming through that same proxy. The request ended up routed to an intact location for the wrong repository.  Further, the information that was logged on the repository access was a mix of information from the repository the user requested and the repository the user actually got. These corrupted logs significantly hampered efforts to discover the extent of the disclosures.</p>\n\n<p>Once the Git proxy got the wrong route, it forwarded the user’s request to git-daemon and ultimately Git, running in the directory for someone else’s repository. If the user was retrieving a specific branch, it generally did not exist, and the pull failed. But if the user was pulling or cloning all branches, that is what they received: all the commits and file objects reachable from all branches in the wrong repository. The user (or more often, their build server) might have been expecting to download one day’s commits and instead received some other repository’s entire history.</p>\n\n<p>Users who inadvertently fetched the entire history of some other repository, surprisingly, may not even have noticed. A subsequent “git pull” would almost certainly have been routed to the right place and would have corrected any overwritten branches in the user’s working copy of their Git repository. The unwanted remote references and tags are still there, though. Such a user can delete the remote references, run “git remote prune origin,” and manually delete all the unwanted tags. As a possibly simpler alternative, a user with unwanted repository data can delete that whole copy of the repository and “git clone” it again.</p>\n\n<h2>\n<a id=\"next-steps\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#next-steps\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span></a>Next steps</h2>\n\n<p>To prevent this from happening again, we will modify the database driver to detect and only interpret responses that match the packet IDs sent by the database. On the application side, we will consolidate the connection pool management so that Active Record's connection pooling will manage all connections. We are following this up by upgrading the application to a newer version of Rails that doesn't suffer from the \"connection reuse\" problem.</p>\n\n<p>We will continue to analyze the events surrounding this incident and use our investigation to improve the systems and processes that power GitHub. We consider the unauthorized exposure of even a single private repository to be a serious failure, and we sincerely apologize that this incident occurred.</p>",

The logger library distributed along with Ruby today no longer shows any vestiges of the previously-existing code—it has evolved magnificently, molded into shape on a variety of different platforms and for a variety of different use cases.</p>\n\n<p>ソフトウェアエンジニアとして働き始めてしばらくして、Rubyに出会いました。それまでは、C、C++、SQLなどで仕事用のソフトウェアを書き、Perlで自分向けの開発支援ツールを書いていました。</p>\n\n<p>オブジェクト指向のなんたるかもよくわからず、勉強がてらそれらツールを移植していき、またRubyコミュニティの流儀にしたがって配布し始めました。その頃はRubyコミュニティも小さく、私のような新参者でも、Rubyコミュニティにいた素晴らしい開発者たちに触れ合える機会が多くあり、Rubyを通じ、ソフトウェア開発のいろいろなことを学びました。</p>\n\n<p>最初にOSS（その頃はfree softwareと呼んでいました）として配布したRubyのプログラムは、ログ取得ライブラリです。今でもRubyでrequire 'logger'すると、いつでも昔の恥ずかしいコードを思い出すことができます。今Rubyと共に配布されているものは、いろいろなプラットフォーム、いろいろな用途の元で叩かれて、立派に成長しており、その頃の面影はもうありません。</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aki: What resources did you have available when you first got into software development?</strong></p>\n\n<p>ソフトウエア開発を始められた当初、お使いになっていたリソースがどのようなものだったか教えて頂けますか？</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nahi:</strong> I wrote SQL, Common Lisp, C—and everything on vi and Emacs. Perl was easy to modify and worked anywhere, so I really treasured it as a resource in my software developer’s toolbelt.</p>\n\n<p>SQL、Common Lisp、C、なんでもviとemacsで書いていました。ソフトウェア開発者のツールベルトに入れる道具として、どこでも動き、変更がし易いPerlは大変重宝しました。</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aki: What advice would you give someone just getting into software development now?</strong></p>\n\n<p>ソフトウエア開発の世界に入ったばかりの方に、どのようなアドバイスを差し上げますか？</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nahi:</strong> I think that I came to be the software engineer I am today by participating in the open source community with loads of great developers and engaging in friendly competition with them, as well as trying out the knowledge I learned from the community in my professional life. As opposed to when I first came across Ruby, there are several unique communities now and a great deal of opportunities to leverage them professionally. I really don’t have much advice to share, but I hope that everyone will seek the opportunity to get to know a lot of great engineers.</p>\n\n<p>ソフトウェア開発者としての私は、よい技術者がたくさん居るOSSコミュニティに参加し、彼らの切磋琢磨に参加することと、そこで得た経験を業務で試した経験により作られたと思っています。 でも、私がRubyと出会った頃とは違い、今はそのようなコミュニティがたくさんありますし、それを業務に活かすチャンスもたくさんありますね。私ができるアドバイスはほとんどありません。みなさんがよい技術者とたくさん知り合えることを祈っています。</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aki: If you forgot everything you knew about software development, and were to start learning to code today, what programming language might you choose and why?</strong></p>\n\n<p>もしソフトウエア開発に関して現在お持ちの知識を全て忘れて、今日からプログラミングを学ぶこととなった場合、どのプログラミング言語を選びますか？またその理由を教えて頂けますか？</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nahi:</strong> I would choose either Ruby or Python. If I still knew what I know now, it would be Python. I would select a language in which the OS and network are hidden only behind a thin veil and easily identified.</p>\n\n<p>RubyかPythonを選びます。もし現在の知識が残っていればPythonですね。薄い皮の下に、OSやネットワークがすぐに見えるような言語をまた選びたいと思います。</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aki: On that note, you make a huge impact as part of Ruby's core contributing team. How specifically did you get started doing that?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rubyのコアコントリビュートチームの一員として、（コミュニティーに）大きなインパクトを与えてこられましたが、具体的にどのような形／きっかけで（Rubyコミュニティーへの貢献を）始められたか教えて頂けますか？</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nahi:</strong> After releasing my first open source software, I went on to release several Ruby libraries that I made for work, such as network proxy, csv, logger, soap, httpclient, and others. With Ruby 1.8, Matz (Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto, the chief designer of Ruby) put a policy in place to expand the Standard Library in order to spread Ruby. This allowed the user to do everything they needed to do without additional libraries by simply installing it. A number of the libraries that I had made were chosen as candidates at the time, and I have mainly maintained the Standard Library ever since. The announced policy to expand the Standard Library was a great coincidence for me, since it allowed me to build experience.</p>\n\n<p>初めてOSSで公開して以後、業務で使うために作ったRubyのライブラリをいくつか公開していきました。network proxy、csv、logger、soap、httpclientなど。Ruby 1.8の時、MatzがRubyを広めるために、標準添付ライブラリを拡充する方針を立てました。インストールすれば、追加ライブラリなしに一通りのことができるようにしよう、というわけです。その際に、私の作っていたライブラリもいくつか候補に選ばれ、以後主に、標準ライブラリのメンテナンスをするようになりました。標準添付ライブラリ拡充方針は、私が経験を積むことが出来たという点で、大変よい偶然でした。</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aki: For new contributors to Ruby, what do you think is the most surprising thing about the process?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rubyの新たなコントリビューターの方にとって、（Rubyコミュニティーの開発）プロセスに関し、どのような部分が最も驚きのある部分とお考えになりますか？</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nahi:</strong> To be honest, I haven’t been able to contribute to Ruby itself over the past few years, so I am not aware of the details on the specific development process. However, I think the most surprising part is that it clearly does not look like there is a process.</p>\n\n<p>In reality, a group of core contributors discuss and make decisions on the direction of development and releases, so to contribute to Ruby itself, you must ultimately propose an idea or make a request to those core contributors.</p>\n\n<p>That’s the same with any community, though. One defining characteristic of the process might be that the proposals can be fairly relaxed, as there is no culture of creating formal documents.</p>\n\n<p>正直に言うと、この数年はRubyそのものへのコントリビュートを行えていないので、具体的な開発プロセス詳細については把握していません。が、明らかに、プロセスがあるように見えないのが、一番驚きのある部分だと思います。</p>\n\n<p>実際には、開発の方向性決定、リリースの決定については、一部のコアなコントリビュータが相談しつつ行っていて、Rubyそのものへのコントリビュートは、最終的には彼/彼女らに対する提案、要望となる必要があります。でもそれは、どのコミュニティでも同じですね。文書化の文化がない分、提案もわりとルーズで構わないのは特徴かもしれません。</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aki: Okay, we have to ask. What is the most interesting pull request you've received for Ruby?</strong></p>\n\n<p>お尋ねしなくてはならないことなのですが。。今までRubyの開発を行ってこられたなかで、（中村さんが）お受けになった最も興味深い／面白いPull Requestはどのようなものでしょうか？</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nahi:</strong> While not necessarily a “pull request,” I have received all sorts of suggestions that stand out: replacing the Ruby execution engine, swapping out the regular expression library, gemifying the Standard Library, etc. As for the most memorable pull request I have received personally, one was a request to swap out the CSV library I made for a different high-speed library. When I think about it with a clear mind, it was a legitimate request, but it took forever to make the right decision.</p>\n\n<p>\"Pull request\"という名前ではありませんが、印象深いものはたくさんあります。Ruby実行エンジンの差し替え、正規表現ライブラリの置き換え、標準ライブラリのgem化など。私個人に関するものとしては、自身の作ったcsvライブラリを、別の高速ライブラリで置き換えたい、というリクエストが一番印象深いものでした。冷静に考えて正しいリクエストでしたが、適切な判断をするために、いちいち時間がかかりました。</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aki: Outside of your open source work, you also work full time as a developer. Does your participation in open source inform choices you make at work? How?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Open Sourceに関する活動とは別に、フルタイムのソフトウエア開発者としてご勤務されていますが、Open Sourceコミュニティへの参加は職場における（日々の）意思決定にどのような影響を与えていますか？</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nahi:</strong> Active involvement in open source is one of the pillars of business at the company I currently work for, and it informs the choices the other engineers and I make unconsciously. When developing something new for the business, we never begin work on a project without examining existing open source software and the open source community. As much as possible, we try not to make anything that replicates what something else does. However, if we believe it necessary, even if existing software does the same thing, we make products the way they should be made. Then, we compete with that and contribute our version back to the world as open source. The experiences and knowledge that we pick up, and also give back through the process, is the lifeblood of software development.</p>\n\n<p>Until I came to my current company a year and a half ago, I led dozens of system development projects, mainly as a technical architect in the enterprise IT world for about 15 years. Back then, I participated in open source individually rather than at my company.</p>\n\n<p>現在所属している会社は、Open Sourceへの積極的な関与をビジネスの柱の一つとしていることもあり、特に意識せずとも、私および各エンジニアの意思決定に影響を与えています。ビジネスのため、何か新しい物を開発する時、既存のOpen Sourceソフトウェア、またOSSコミュニティの調査なしに作り始めることはありません。可能な限り、用途が重複するものは作りません。しかしそうと信じれば、用途が同じでも、あるべき姿のものを作ります。そしてそれは、Open Sourceとして世の中に還元し、競争していきます。そのような中で得られる、また提供できる経験、知見は、ソフトウェア開発の血液のようなものです。</p>\n\n<p>唐突ですが、1年半前に現在の会社に来る前までは、15年ほど、エンタープライズITの世界で、主にテクニカルアーキテクトとして数十のシステム開発プロジェクトをリードしていました。その頃は、会社ではなく個人でOSS活動を行っていました。</p>\n\n<p><strong>Aki: Tell us about your view on where the enterprise IT world is lagging behind. How do you see the open source developer community making a contribution to change that?</strong></p>\n\n<p>エンタープライズITの世界がどのような点で（Open Source等の世界）から遅れているとお考えになるか教えて頂けますか？Open Sourceコミュニティーのソフトウエア開発者の方々が、（エンタープライズITの状況を）変革させることに、どのような貢献ができるとお考えになっているか教えて頂けますか？</p>\n\n<p><strong>Nahi:</strong> In the enterprise IT world, we were trying to create a future that was predictable in order to control the complexity of business and the possibility of change. Now, however, it is hard to predict what things will be like one or two years down the road. The influence of this unpredictability is growing so significant that it cannot be ignored. Luckily, I was given the opportunity to lead a variety of projects, and what helped me out then was the experiences and knowledge I had picked up by being involved in the open source community.</p>\n\n<p>To be honest, developers participating in the open source community now have already made a variety of contributions to the enterprise IT world, and I am one of those beneficiaries. To enhance the software development flow, developers in the enterprise IT world need to participate more in open source. I would venture to say that establishing such an environment and showing understanding towards it may be thought of as further contributions on the enterprise side.</p>\n\n<p>エンタープライズITの世界では、ビジネスの複雑さと変更可能性をcontrolするため、予測可能な未来を作ろうとしていました。しかし今では、1年、2年後を予測するのは困難です。この予測できないことの影響は、無視できないほど大きくなっています。私は幸いにも、各種プロジェクトをリードする機会を与えられました。その時に役立ったのは、Open Sourceコミュニティとの関わりの中で得られた経験、知見でした。</p>\n\n<p>正直に言うと、現在Open Sourceコミュニティに参加している開発者は、エンタープライズITの世界に、既に様々な貢献をされていると思います。私もその恩恵を受けた一人です。\nソフトウェア開発の血液を循環させるためには、エンタープライズITの世界に居る開発者が、もっとOpen Sourceコミュニティに参加できるようにならないといけません。しいて言えば、そのような環境を整えること、理解を示すこと、などは、更なる貢献として考えられることかもしれません。</p>\n\n<p>To learn more about Nahi’s contributions to Ruby, visit his GitHub profile page <a href=\"https://github.com/nahi\">here</a>.

The policy consists of four parts:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/#building-a-strong-community\">Best practices for building a strong community</a> - people are encouraged to be welcoming, assume no malice, stay on topic, and use clear and concise language at all times.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/#what-if-something-or-someone-offends-you\">What to do if something offends you</a> - project maintainers are encouraged to communicate expectations and to moderate comments within their community — including locking conversations or blocking users when necessary.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/#what-is-not-allowed\">What behavior is not allowed on GitHub</a> - the community will not tolerate threats of violence, hate speech, bullying, harassment, impersonation, invasions of privacy, sexually explicit content, or active malware.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/#what-happens-if-someone-breaks-the-rules\">What happens if someone breaks the rules</a> - GitHub may block or remove content and may terminate or suspend accounts that violate these rules.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As always, we will continue to investigate any abuse reports and may moderate public content on our site that we determine to be in violation of our Terms of Service. To be clear, GitHub does not actively seek out content to moderate. Instead, we rely on community members like you to communicate expectations, moderate projects, and <a href=\"https://github.com/contact/report-abuse\">report abusive behavior or content</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, we are releasing the guidelines under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">the Creative Commons Zero License</a> in hopes of encouraging other platforms to establish similar norms to govern their respective communities.</p>\n\n<p>These guidelines are first and foremost <em>community</em> guidelines and we'd like to hear your thoughts on them before they're finalized. Please <a href=\"https://github.com/contact/community-guidelines\">get in touch with us with any feedback or questions</a> <strong>prior to November 20th, 2016</strong>. Together, we can make the open source community a healthy, inclusive place we can all be proud of.</p>",
